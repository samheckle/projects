this was an exploration into discord bots, and my first time making one. in a nutshell, check out [my repository](https://github.com/samheckle/tanatimer) and [add this to your discord](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=746124476122398751&permissions=2048&scope=bot)! if you want to see a new feature, please make an issue and i will try to get to it. 

if you don't know what the pomodoro method is, you might want to [read up on it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). effectively, it is chunking out time so that you can work more effectively. most of the time you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break. so, i built a discord bot to help me with that.

this blog assumes you have no familiarity with discord bots, so i will start with the basics (read: this was my first discord bot).
