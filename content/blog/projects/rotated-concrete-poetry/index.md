## inspiration

i recently went to the MOMA and was inspired by the shape of Judith Lauand's *Concreto 61*
![concerto 61](./concreto61.jpg)

there is something about the simplicity and the shape that seemed conducive to text, and i wanted to utilize the same format to create my own poetry.

## process 

first was getting the rotation of the letters correct. since i was doing this dynamically with python rather than with illustrator or a graphical interface, it was challenging to get the rotations working.

![i also tried rotating the letters but did not like the effect since it made the text unreadable](./rotation.png)

![i was having issues trying to get four quadrants of this rotation working as well, but i think the output was beautiful regardless.](./test-div-rotation.png)

these experiments did have some beautiful outputs that i might want to explore in terms of using ascii art with my python generated concrete poetry.
