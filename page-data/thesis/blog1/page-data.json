One of the earliest examples is <a href=\"https://blackbird.vcu.edu/v1n1/nonfiction/king_e/prayer_print.htm\">Clockwork Prayer</a>.

It’s the cosmic BuzzFeed quiz.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Twitter allows astrologers to push out updates to fans that keep pace with the news, and A.I. and machine learning can churn out predictions at speeds unmatched by flesh-and-blood astrologers. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This <em>other</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/style/astrology-apps-venture-capital.html\">NYT</a> article is about the interest of VCs in astrology, and dives into the Sanctuary app specifically. The key difference between Santuary and Co-Star is that the former uses a real person, “We’re not trying to be some sort of spiritual Alexa, where we’re using AI to replace someone,” he said. “If you think about the practice, it’s really emotional.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The apps create a shortcut to intimacy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In that way it doesn’t even matter that the science is actually fake.
